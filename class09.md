Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

>“Complexity is anything that makes software hard to understand or to modify." — John Outerhout

What is functional programming?

a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data 

## Pure functions

* It returns the same result if given the same arguments

* It does not cause any observable side effects

## Pure functions benefits

1- Immutability

Unchanging over time or unable to be changed.

When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

2- Referential transparency

> pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency

# THe End
